    <h1>WELCOME TO THE FIRST LESSON</h1>
    <p>ðŸ§  The Basics of Coding in HTML, From My Point of View as a Beginner
        When I first started learning HTML (which stands for HyperText Markup Language), <br>
        I honestly didnâ€™t know where to begin. But once I understood that HTML is the foundation of all websites, things started making sense. <br> 
        Itâ€™s not really a programming language, itâ€™s more of a markup language used to structure web pages.</p>
        <h3>ðŸ“„ 1. Starting with the Basic Structure</h3>
            <p>Every HTML file needs a basic skeleton. Here's what I learned:</p>
        <img decoding="async" src="src/image.png" width="150" height="100" />
        <p> <!DOCTYPE html> tells the browser I'm writing HTML5. <br>

            <img src="src/html.png" width="40" height="25" />Is the root of the document. <br>
            
             <img src="src/title.png" width="40" height="25" />Contains meta information (like the page title). <br>
            
             <img src="src/head.png" width="40" height="25" />Shows the name in the browser tab. <br>
            
             <img src="src/body.png" width="40" height="25" /> Is the visible part, where all the content goes.
